Code objectives:
- Take out the implementation / Understand from scratch for attackers
- Implementing backdoor attackers 
- Implement basic federated learning - client inputs - choose datasets, no. of clients, dirlichlet alpha to vary IDT, no of rounds between server and client
- code should call server -> split dataset based on alpha, create and assign ids to client and get section of dataset and train models


Understand a backdoor attack:
- local datasets manipulate the dataset and add a pattern to a particular images, class label flipped
- dynamic backdoor attacks, non-persistent attacker
- detection of the above attackers
